# Whenever there is an SSH, there is a way

This Repo, is about demonstrating a little bit about my new challenges which I faced in Huawei Technologies as a Data Analyst.

Solution is separated into 4 steps:
1. Making a Efficient way for collecting data from a nested SSH connection by taking advantage of python's web scrapping libraries and a web-based SSH client.
2. transfer and load the collected data in data-warehouse/Local-Disk
3. Data preprocess and re-framing (aggregation)
4. representing the result using Tableau
